# Introduction
This application called “StudentCare” will allow students to sort out their mental
health problems through contacting and getting a counselling session from the various
counsellors that the app provides. Student can also relief some of their stress by having a
random stranger to talk to about their problems and struggles. This application will also
inadvertently raise the awareness of the public towards the struggles that current students face and also the existence of applications that provide solutions to these struggles.
